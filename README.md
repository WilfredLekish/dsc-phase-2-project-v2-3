# Phase 2 Project Description â€“ Wilfred Lekishoromongi

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a multiple linear regression model. The dataset contains various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage of living space, waterfront status, house condition, and grade, among others. The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts house prices based on these features.

## Business and Data Understanding
The stakeholders for this project include real estate agencies, property investors, and individuals looking to buy or sell houses. These stakeholders are interested in understanding how different factors affect house prices, which can inform their decisions regarding buying, selling, or investing in real estate. 

The dataset provides valuable insights into the housing market, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions based on market trends and property characteristics.

## Modelling
The modelling process involves pre-processing the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering. We then split the data into training and testing sets and build a multiple linear regression model to predict house prices. The model utilizes various features to make predictions and is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared to assess its performance.

## Regression Results
The final model achieved a training R-squared score of approximately 0.676 and a testing R-squared score of about 0.63. These scores indicate decent predictive performance, suggesting that the model captures a significant portion of the variance in house prices. 

The model's coefficients provide insights into the relative importance of different features in determining house prices, which can be valuable for stakeholders in the real estate industry.

## Conclusion
Overall, this project demonstrates the utility of multiple linear regression in predicting house prices based on various features. By leveraging data-driven insights, stakeholders can make more informed decisions regarding buying, selling, or investing in real estate. Moving forward, further refinements to the model and additional data sources could enhance its predictive accuracy and provide even more valuable insights for stakeholders in the housing market.
